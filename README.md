# horseon-code-refactor
This was a code refactoring job done to clean up an existing code.
Changes were made to the html structure in order to make it easier to read, as well as in css. 
The html structure was given a different title, semantic HTML elements, and accessible alt attributes.
The css was compressed to give it a easier structure to follow.
